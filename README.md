# Solstice Code Challenge

Completed by Amanda Treutler for consideration.

## Installation

Clone this repository to your local machine, navigate to the project directory from your command line and run the following commands in sequence:

```bash
npm i
npm start
```

The project will then be viewable at http://localhost:3000/

## Usage

View a list of contacts with favorited contacts separated into their own group. Click any contact to view details about that specific contact. Click the star in the upper right-hand corner of the contact details page to toggle favorite status. The main page will be updated to reflect this change.

This project is responsive and should be viewed properly on any size device up to 1024px, but is optimized for mobile viewing with a minimum width of 320px.
